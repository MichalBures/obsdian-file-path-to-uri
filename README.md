This plugin lets you convert a local path to a file url link that can be used to link to files or folders that are located outside of your Obsidian vault.

## How to use this plugin

1. Select the whole path you want to convert.
2. Use the hotkey `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + L` or press `Ctrl/Cmd + P` to open the command palette and search for `File path to URI: Toggle selected file path to URI and back`.
3. The selected path will toggle between file path and file url.

## Roadmap

- **Add option to select custom hotkeys**
  
    I admit I haven't look very hard, but I don't think there is an easy way to add this right now without coding the whole thing by myself. When Obsidian adds hotkey chooser to their settings I'll happily use it.
